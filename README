Simple fractals demo using
Castle Game Engine [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/]
utilities (TCastleWindow and other helpers).

To compile: get Castle Game Engine source code from
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php,
unpack such that fractals-demo-cge and castle_game_engine directories
are siblings, and compile using ./compile.sh. You will need FPC
[http://www.freepascal.org/] to compile.
