Simple fractals demo using
Castle Game Engine [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/]
utilities (TCastleWindow and other helpers).

To compile: get Castle Game Engine source code from
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php, and

1. Use Lazarus: Install Lazarus [http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/],
   with FPC (default Lazarus installation packs include FPC already).
   Compile Lazarus packages in castle_game_engine/packages/*.lpk.
   Then open and compile in Lazarus fractals.lpi project file.

2. Use command-line FPC: You will need FPC [http://www.freepascal.org/].
   Unpack Castle Game Engine source such that
   fractals-demo-cge and castle_game_engine directories
   are siblings. Compile by

     cd fractals-demo-cge/
     ./compile.sh

3. Use command-line FPC with castle-engine build tool.
   See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool .
   Run "castle-engine compile".
