Simple fractals demo using
Castle Game Engine [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/]
utilities (TCastleWindow and other helpers).

To compile: get Castle Game Engine source code from
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php, and

1. Use command-line FPC: unpack Castle Game Engine source
   such that fractals-demo-cge and castle_game_engine directories
   are siblings, and compile using ./compile.sh. You will need FPC
   [http://www.freepascal.org/] to compile.

2. Use Lazarus: install also Lazarus [http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/].
   Compile in Lazarus packages in castle_game_engine/packages/.
   Then open and compile in Lazarus fractals.lpi project file.
